Shopping Cart Assignment - Build Restocking Functionality (120:00)

In this exercise, you’ll focus on building that restocking functionality. To accomplish this, you’ll need to make a call to a Strapi API and get a fresh list of available products.

Here’s how the reset stock feature works:
- There’s an input field on the page that contains the URL to the Strapi back end
- When a user clicks the "ReStock Products" button, a call is made to the Strapi back end specified in the input field
- The result of this call is an updated list of products

Your task is to implement the restock feature. You should add your code to the "cart.jsx" file. More specifically, you need to implement the “restockProducts” function on line number 169 of the file. 

Download these files (restock-shopping-cart_starter.zip: cart.jsx, index.html) to get started.

Hints: 
- Make use of the "doFetch" function to make a call to the API
- Make use of "setItems" to update the existing items
